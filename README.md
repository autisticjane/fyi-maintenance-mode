# FYI Maintenance Mode
This exists because I just wanted a really simple maintenance mode page for WordPress and none of the bells and whistles offered by the other plugins on the market, because ain't nobody got time to spend more energy on a freaking maintenance mode instead of, uh, THE ACTUAL WEBSITE.

I don't care what you do with this. It's super basic and you can find it anywhere, I just packaged it up all nicely for you to download as a ZIP if you so please.

## Installation
1. Upload via the Plugins page on your WordPress dashboard, or extract via your control panel into ``wp-content/plugins``.
2. Edit the HTML of the plugin to change the message so it says what you want it to say.
